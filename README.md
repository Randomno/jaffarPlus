# JaffarPlus

High-performance bot for tool-assisted speedrunning. This project is based on [Jaffar](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffar), a solver for the original Prince of Persia (DOS). JaffarPlus is:

* High-Performance: JaffarPlus is tailored for multi-core CPUs, especially for high core counts.
* Multi-Platform: As of writing this note, JaffarPlus supports games from multiple consoles/plaftforms, e.g., NES, SNES, Genesis, SDLPoP.
* Extensible: Any new emulators or games that support load/save and advance step functions can be added to JaffarPlus via a common API

A list of TAS movies produced by eien86 using JaffarPlus can be found [here](https://tasvideos.org/Subs-List?user=eien86&statusfilter=6)

This project is developed and mantained by Sergio Martin (martiser@ethz.ch). Contributions via pull requests are highly appreciated.
