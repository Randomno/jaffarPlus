# JaffarPlus

![](jaffar.png)

High-performance bot for tool-assisted speedrunning, JaffarPlus is:

* High-Performance: Tailored for multi-core CPUs, especially for high core counts.
* Multi-Platform: Supports games from multiple consoles/game emulators
* Extensible: Any new emulators or games that support load/save and advance step functions can be added to JaffarPlus via a common API

This work is based on [Jaffar](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffar), a solver for the original Prince of Persia (DOS).
